Hello, I'm Zachary Kirby. 

I've dabbled in a lot. 
I'm most excited by game engine design. 
I like hearing many different perspectives about best coding practices,and
aim for code style that makes sense for the project at hand.
My way of thinking leans towards data oriented programming generally,
though I have a habit of writing code in OOP style.

I have a website talking about what I think about coding,
and workflows I've picked up over time.
