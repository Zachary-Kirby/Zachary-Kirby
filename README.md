Hello, I'm Zachary Kirby.  
As a coder, I'm interested in just about anything (cryptography, scientific models, ai, game engines, simulations, ect.). As a programmer, I prefer designing game engines and simulations.
I'm currently learning game engine design and 3D graphics. My current profficiency lies in 2D games using Python or C++ at an intermediate level. I say this because I am still studying proffesional practices and could work on my code tidyness, but I have written almost fully complete games.
